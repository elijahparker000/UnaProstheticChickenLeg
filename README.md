This is a repo for the files associated with my attempt to make a 3D printed prosthetic leg for a chicken named Una. Be sure to check out my blog post [here](https://elijahparker000.com/projects/Prosthetic-Chicken-Leg-Mk-2-Una/) for more info. The basic idea is that I created a 3D printable mold to make a custom silicone piece to fit Una's nub and then designed a 3D printed leg which clamps around the silicone piece with screws. Detailed information is on my website.
